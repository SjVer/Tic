# "function.tic" is in the same directory as this script, that's why this syntax can be used.
# Otherwise the script should be given as a path in a string

Use function

# myfunc is defined in "function.tic" and thus imported.
Call myfunc

# mysecondfunc takes a number and a bool
Call mysecondfunc With 2.5, true

# the variables declared are also imported
Set mynum = 123.456
PrintLine mynum
PrintLine mybool
