# AttemptIDE
AttemptLang's official IDE
<br/>
<br/>
### Features
AttemptIDE comes with little, yet all the neccesary features. These include basic editing shortcuts, multiple file support, and a compile-and-run function. These can all be accessed both through the menubar and shortcuts.
<br/>
<br/>
### Compile And Run
Scripts can be compiled and ran directly from the IDE.
<br/> To do this, select your preferred method in the 'Run' menu or use either 'Control B' (compile and run in editor) or 'Control Shift B' (compile and run in new terminal window).
<br/>
<br/>
### Other Files
AttemptIDE fully supports the editing of any file, but naturally only '.Al' files can be compiled and ran.
<br/>
<br/>
### Installment And Dependencies
The deb file for AttemptIDE can be downloaded from the releases page of this github repo. It has some dependencies, including the AttemptLang compiler (also available at the releases page) but nothing big or unstable.
